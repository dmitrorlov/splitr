<img src="assets/settings.png" width="500px" alt="Send all traffic over VPN"/>
</p>

1. **Configure your VPN and disable "Send all traffic over VPN"**

3. **Install Splitr** using one of the methods from the [Installation](#installation) section

4. **Launch Splitr** from Applications and add your network hosts or IP ranges

5. **Connect your VPN** and Splitr will automatically manage the routing rules

6. **Use the Sync button**: If routing is not applied correctly, click the "Sync" button in Splitr to refresh the routing configuration

7. **Reconnect VPN if needed**: If routing issues persist, disconnect and reconnect your VPN connection to ensure proper route establishment

That's it! Your specified hosts will now route through the VPN while other traffic uses your regular connection.
